            More than 5 million self-employed and freelancers in the UK are not
            currently eligible to receive income support from the UK Government.
            This is largely due to the administrative complexities associated
            with self-employed income.

              This is a proof of concept to demonstrate how open banking data
              could support freelancers in the COVID-19 economic crisis. The UK
              Government announced an historic level of support for PAYE
              employees who find themselves without work because of COVID-19
              (furlonged employees) will receive up to 80% of their income or
              £2,500 (whichever is lower).

              By collecting historic banking data it is possible to prove
              previous income to be eligible for income relief from the UK
              Government. Our objective is to demonstrate this for the UK
              Government in the hope this can help those in need in a time of
              crisis.

              At this stage the UK Government has not announced any support for
              freelancers or sole traders. An intended consequence of this proof
              of concept is that HM Government may look to introduce this
              service (or a service like it). Whilst you can access Universal
              Credit, we would encourage you to write to your MP to make them
              aware of this project.
